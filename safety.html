<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About safety in college, vivehanandha is having a strong security system like for hostellers if you are getting back in college after holiday you should be with your ID card to pass the amin gate and if you are going for holidays you will definitely have to get the hostel gate pass from the wordon and should give a tumb impression in the bio metric machine and which will automatically give text notifications to your parents mobile or to the number your parents given as guardians.after hostel security system you must have to go to main gate to swipe your ID card and then again your parent will receive a notification as "your daugter is leaving the main gate".actually this will be to tiring for student but definitely blessing for parents and in hostel each night you have to give thumb impression attendence in different bio metric machine.if u fail to give attendence at 8.30pm fine Rs.100 will be demand for you.</p>
